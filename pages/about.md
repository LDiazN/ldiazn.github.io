# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a **computer engineering** student graduating in Q1 2023 with a passion for game development and entertainment technology. I am proficient in modern **C++** and have experience with **real-time mesh slicing** in **C\#** with **Unity**. I have also created a **ray tracer** and have participated in the **Global Game Jam** in my country. I am particularly interested in **engine**, **graphics**, and **gameplay programming**. I am excited to work on ambitious new projects in game development to create new, useful tools for artists that help them create the best possible games.
