Hi I am **Luis Diaz** ðŸ‘‹,

I'm a **graduate Computer Engineer** with a passion for software engineering, game development and entertainment technology. I love coding in **C++**, **C#**, and **Rust** for game development and graphics programming related subjects. Additionally, I am interested in **machine learning** and **backend development**, as I have work experience in those areas. I participate in the Global Game Jam in my country almost every year. I am particularly interested in engine, graphics, and gameplay programming. I am always happy to learn and share the projects I am working on!

<strong> Code for Venezuela </strong>  <i> <small> April 2021 - Jan. 2022 </small> </i> 
</div>

I created a news classifier tool using **Python** and **HuggingFace's transformers** for **Natural Language Processing**. Its purpose was to find issues with public services in Venezuela that were otherwise non-registered. This project taught me about software development best practices, machine learning with Python for natural language processing (NLP), deploying applications in **Google Cloud Platform** and how to use Data Engineering workflows. The goal of this project was to identify the most important issues on public services so that efforts could be directed toward solving them. You can find the library that was developed for this project **[here!](https://github.com/code-for-venezuela/c4v-py)**

**Skills**: Google BigQuery, NoSQL, Python (Programming Language), PyTorch, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Software Development

# Awards

### 2nd Place ICPC 2019
**The International Collegiate Programming Contest** (ICPC) is an algorithmic programming competition 
for college students. Our team **placed 2nd** in Venezuela and 83rd in the North
Region of South America! This achievement demonstrates my proficiency in algorithms and data
structures and my ability to combine complex concepts to implement efficient solutions.
