- title: Computer Engineering student, Universidad Simón Bolívar, Venezuela
  from: April 2016
  to: March 2023
  description: The <b>study plan</b> includes algorithms and data structures, discrete math, software engineering, low level programming, 
               operative systems, calculus, linear algebra, scientific computing and developing programming languages and compilers. 
               My <b>most remarkable homework projects</b> include a 
               <b>virtual machine</b> written in <b>C++</b> for the intermediate code (TAC) generated by <b>a compiler</b>
               I also worked on, a simple <b>AR game</b> developed in <b>Unity</b> with Vuforia.

- title: Data Engineering Intern, Code for Venezuela
  from: April 2021
  to: January 2022
  description: "I created a <b>news classifier tool</b> using Python and HuggingFace's transformers for <b>Natural Language Processing</b>. Its purpose was to find issues with public 
              services in Venezuela that were otherwise non-registered. This project taught me about <b>software development</b> best practices, 
              <b>machine learning</b> with Python for natural language processing (NLP), deploying applications in <b>Google Cloud Platform</b> and how to use Data Engineering workflows. 
              The goal of this project was to identify the most important issues on public services so that efforts could be directed toward solving them.
