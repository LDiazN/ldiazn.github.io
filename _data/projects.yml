  desc: Shoot at the armored robot to blast its armor and see through it! In this <strong>UE4 project</strong> I showcase dynamic damage over meshes triggered by 
        player attacks in real time, achieving a very satisfying feeling of impact for the guns! Check the code on <strong> Github </strong>!
